1.a.Difference between Statically typed and Dynamically typed languages

Statically typed languages
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is; other languages (e.g.: Java, C, C++) offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).

The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).

Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang

Most scripting languages have this feature as there is no compiler to do static type-checking anyway, but you may find yourself searching for a bug that is due to the interpreter misinterpreting the type of a variable. Luckily, scripts tend to be small so bugs have not so many places to hide.

1.b.Difference between Scripting and Programming languages

Scripting Language:

in the normal case, you have to compile a C program before you can run it. But in the normal case, you don't have to compile a JavaScript program before you run it. So JavaScript is sometimes called a "scripting" language.
Some examples of "scripting" languages
Lua
JavaScript
VBScript and VBA
Perl
A scripting language is used to write code that is going to target a software system. It's going to automate operations on that software system. The script is going to be a sequence of instructions to the target software system.
In the other hand, the target software system of an script may compile the code or interpret it. Is up to the software system.

Programming language:

A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.
Python is the most commonly used programming language.
A programming language targets the computing system, which can be a real or virtual machine. The instructions are executed by the machine.

Of course, a real machine understands only binary code so you need to compile the code of a programming language. But this is a consequence of targeting a machine instead of a program.

3.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Http1.1:

Comparatively 1.1 is slower.
loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
Status codes were used to indicate successful requests and to indicate transmission errors.
Text based protocol that is in the readable form
SSL is not required but recommended. Digest authentication used in HTTP1.1 is an improvement over HTTP1.0. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for secure encrypted communication.

Http2:

version 2 is much faster.
is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same.
It is a binary protocol i.e. only binary commands in the form of 0s and 1s are transmitted over the wire. The binary framing layer divides the message into frames that are segregated based on their type – Data or Header. This feature greatly increases efficiency in terms of security, compression and multiplexing.
Though security is still not mandatory, it is mostly encrypted (though it is not enforced) since almost all clients require traffic to be encrypted. It also has some minimum standards, such as minimum key size for encryption. TLS 1.2 etc.
